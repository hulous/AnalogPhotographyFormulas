The Zone System is used in light mesure to ensure a good visualisation of the subject.
Hand Meters are calibrated to give a good expose for a 18% gray card. Zone system help to be more precise when our subject is darker or not.

This is a Ansel Adams' legacy. [This is the wikipedia page about this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_System).
