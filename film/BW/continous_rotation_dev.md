I use jobo cpe rotary processor for film development (135 and 120).

I don't use it anymore and I don't recommend it for two reasons I guess:
   - It is necessary to adapt development times and dilutions (approximately -20% development time and +30% water in the base mixture) for uncertain results.
   - It seems that you lose image quality (especially sharpness) when you exceed 18x24 enlargments for 135 and 20x30 enlargments for 120.

I try to compensate with stand up time and dilution based computations, but I am not sure results are better than traditional ways of developments. 

This continous rotation are used for color films. Because they need it (and quite other steps). But for B&W I am not shure about it. 
_I know that how labs proceeds b&w films..._
