## Chemistry Formulas

  * Dev:
    * Tetenal eukobrom : 1+9 @ 20° (manual deals about 60 to 90 seconds as dev time)
    * Ilford PQ : 1+9 @ 20° (manual deals about 60 seconds as dev time)
  * Water
  * Fix: same as film.

  * Notes about quantities : 1 liter for format less than 24x30 is ok... 2 liter for 24x30 better


## timesheet

Concentration or product type is not important here. 
If paper is well exposed, 2 minutes is ok. 

### Dev
  * 120 secondes or 30/45 secondes after image appear.

### Stop

### Fix
  * 2 minutes or more (no more than 5 minutes !)

  * Can use 2 bath (divide time by 2, so 1 minute per bath):
    * first one will receive on the use papers from stop bath (so first bath will contain after the session some of the stop bath chemistry)
    * second one will stay more pure and we can add taner to it.
